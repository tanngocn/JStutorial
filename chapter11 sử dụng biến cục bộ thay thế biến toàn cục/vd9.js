var peaks = new Counter();
var climbs = new Counter();
console.log(peaks.count());


/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) At the console prompt,
 *    call peaks.count and climbs.count
 *    a number of times.
 *
 * 2) Add a countDown method to the
 *    Counter constructor.
 *    The method should decrease the counter
 *    by 1 each time it is called.
 *
 * 3) Add a countUpBy method that counts up
 *    by a specified amont.
 *    e.g.
 *    > peaks.count()
 *      1
 *    > peaks.countUpBy(5)
 *      6
 *    > peaks.countDown()
 *      5
