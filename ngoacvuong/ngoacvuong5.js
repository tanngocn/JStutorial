/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Add more tweets to the tweets array
 *    and run the program again.
 *    They don't have to be tweets,
 *    any text will do.
 *
 * The program sees it and It as different words.
 * The string method toLowerCase will convert
 * a string to all lowercase.
 * "I Love NASA".toLowerCase() is "i love nasa"
 *
 * 2) Change the keys in the square brackets
 *    to use word.toLowerCase() instead of word.
 *    Make sure you change them all.
 *
 * 3) Can you change the keys to upper case?
