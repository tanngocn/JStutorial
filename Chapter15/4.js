/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Run the program.
 *
 * 2) At the console prompt, type the following,
 *    pressing Enter after each one:
 *
 *    > var mapData = theCrypt.mapData
 *    > mapData
 *    > mapData.title
 *    > mapData.places
 *    > mapData.places[0]
 *    > mapData.places[0].description
 *
 * 3) Create a new empty place and assign it
 *    to a variable.
 *
 *    > var place = {}
 *
 * 4) Add title and description properties
 *    to the place.
 *
 *    > place.title = "The Games Room"
 *
 * 5) Add the place to the mapData places array.
 *
 *    > mapData.places.push(place)
